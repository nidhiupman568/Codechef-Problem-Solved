# Welcome to My Competitive Programming Journey! 🚀✨

👋Hello there! 👋 I'm Nidhi Upman 😀, a passionate 🔥 competitive programmer 👩‍💻. I actively 💪 participate in CodeChef 🥘 contests 🏆 and continuously 🔄 improve my coding skills 💻. Here's a bit about my journey 🛤️ and the various topics 📚 I've mastered 🧠 along the way 🛤️.

## My CodeChef Journey 🏆

🏆In the beginning 🏁, I could only solve 🔍 1️⃣-2️⃣ questions ❓ in each contest 🏁. However, I never gave up 🙅‍♂️. After the contests 🏁, I would meticulously 🔍 upsolve 📈 the problems 🛠️ I couldn't solve 🔍 during the contest ⏱️. Over time ⏳, things started to make sense 💡, and I began solving more questions ❓. This persistent effort 💪 led me to become a 3-star 🌟 coder on CodeChef 🥘. 🌟

Every Wednesday 🗓️, I participate 🏃‍♂️ in the contests 🏆 without fail ❗. Additionally, I work 🛠️ on the remaining questions ❓ daily 🗓️ to ensure I don't leave any stone unturned 🔄.

## Languages and Tools 🛠️
